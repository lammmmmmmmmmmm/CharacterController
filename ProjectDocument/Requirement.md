## Camera
- Camera rotation speed/damping
- Camera follow speed/damping
- Mouse smooth
- Look ahead
- Zoom

## Jump
- [ ] Hold to jump higher
- [ ] Jump buffer
- [ ] Coyote time
- [ ] Limit air control
- [ ] Ceiling check
- [ ] Ground check
- [x] Max height
- [x] Time to reach max height
  - Animation curve
- [x] Gravity
- Having a fall curve is quite complicated, since player can fall from different heights.
  
## Movement
- [ ] Turn acceleration
- [x] Max speed
- [x] Multiple speeds
  - Walk
  - Run
- Since we are using multiple speeds, the acceleration and deceleration should be linear.
  - If we want to use curves, we have to make different acceleration and deceleration curves for each speed.

## Physics Interaction
- [x] Slope
- [x] Stairs
- [x] Uneven ground
- [ ] Wall jump
- [x] Moving platform
- [x] Rotating platform
- [ ] Fluid
- [x] Trampoline
